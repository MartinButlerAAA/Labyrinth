# Labyrinth

A game where the player has to find their way out of a maze, to get to the next level.

I had wanted to do a maze game for many years. I did a version in Scratch during the pandemic ([3D Maze](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/377509068/)), but this only had one fixed maze. I've re-written the game for Wii U, as I wanted to develop an algorithm for generating random mazes. 

The game has a retro green-screen look. The sound effects are borrowed from [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). The music was composed during the pandemic using NCH Crescendo and MixPad. The sound and graphics are based on those used for in my [Connect4](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/Connect4) game. I have also produced a Wiki about what I've learn't while developing Wii U Homebrew games, see [PacMan-ish Wiki](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/PacMan-ishU/wiki). The Wiki also covers what I learnt about the sound API.

The game is deliberately very retro, but I hope you like it.
